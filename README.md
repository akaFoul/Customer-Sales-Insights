## Business Problem Statement
-The company has accumulated a large amount of sales and customer data, but decision-makers lack clear insights into which products drive revenue, how sales trends vary over time, and what customer segments contribute most to growth. Without these insights, it is difficult to optimize product strategy, allocate marketing spend effectively, and improve customer retention.

This project aims to analyze sales and customer data using SQL, Excel, and Power BI to identify top-performing products, understand sales patterns, segment customers by demographics and regions, and evaluate the effectiveness of different sales channels. The final outcome will be an interactive dashboard that helps stakeholders make data-driven business decisions.

## Goals
- Top selling products
- Monthly Sales Trends
- Customers segmentation
- Channels (online vs offline)
